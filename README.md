# 🚗 Driver Distraction Detection using YOLO

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time driver distraction detection system** using a trained **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model**.

The system is specifically designed to detect **mobile phone usage while driving**, one of the leading causes of road accidents.  
By leveraging a lightweight YOLO architecture, the model achieves **high accuracy and fast inference**, making it suitable for real-time deployment using a webcam.

## 🎯 Detection Focus
The model is trained to identify the following class:

- **Using Phone While Driving**

> The model intentionally focuses on a single high-risk distraction to improve precision and reduce false detections.
